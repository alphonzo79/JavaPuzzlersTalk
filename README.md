# JavaPuzzlersTalk
This repository holds the project to implement a number of small programs that implement select puzzles from Joshua Bloch and Neal Gafter's Java Puzzlers book and is meant to be used for Code Camp talks.

The book "Java Puzzlers - Traps, Pitfalls and Corner Cases" is available through <a href="http://amzn.com/032133678X">Amazon</a> and I highly recommend you order it if you are interested in some of the fine points of Java. (Another must-have, also authored by Joshua Bloch is <a href="http://amzn.com/0321356683 ">Effective Java</a>)

There are 95 puzzlers in the book. This project is a collection of those that seemed most useful, interesting or surprising to me.
